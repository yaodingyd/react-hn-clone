This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This is a Hack News clone using React, Redux and React-router with Firebase API.

### Actions

The app's action is simple enough: there is request and receive for each story, user and comment.

### State

There is three reducers: newslist, user and comment.

### How to dispatch actions on page load

Since I'm using React-router to do routing, on each tab click I would dispatch a story request.
